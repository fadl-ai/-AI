AI News Analyzer - Setup Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you set up and use the AI News Analyzer application. Follow the steps carefully to get everything working smoothly.

----------------------------
Prerequisites
----------------------------
Before you start, make sure you have:
- Python 3.8 or higher installed
- pip (Python package manager)
- A modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

----------------------------
Step 1: Clone the Repository
----------------------------
1. Create a new folder anywhere on your computer
2. Copy all the project files into this folder

----------------------------
Step 6: Using the Application
----------------------------
1. When you run the app, it will open in your browser
2. You can:
   - Enter a news article URL to analyze
   - Paste article text directly
   - View analysis results and confidence scores
   - See detailed explanations of the analysis

----------------------------
Troubleshooting
----------------------------
If you run into problems, check these tips:

1. Backend Connection Issues
   - Make sure the Flask server is running (you’ll see output in the terminal)
   - Use the correct backend URL in the frontend code
   - Check your browser's developer console (F12) for errors

2. Model Loading Issues
   - Make sure your model files are in the 'models' folder
   - Check the 'logs' folder for any error messages
   - Ensure you have enough disk space for the model files

3. Dependency Issues
   - Confirm all required packages are installed
   - Try updating pip:
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   - If a package fails, try installing it individually

- models/        : Folder containing the AI model files
- logs/          : Where the application logs are saved
